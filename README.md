This project created by me in order to practice some programming skills.

It could also be used later as a starting point for consulting and freelancing business.

Running the app requires mongodb. Here are some useful commands that I always forget:

    #logFile location - /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log
    # datadir - /var/lib/mongodb

    - sudo service mongod start
    - sudo service mongod stop
    - sudo service mongod restart
